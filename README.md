## Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the NFL Scounting Combine from 2009 to 2019. 

The NFL Scouting Combine is a week-long showcase occurring every February at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, where college football players perform physical and mental tests in front of National Football League coaches, general managers, and scouts. With increasing interest in the NFL Draft, the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting.

Athletes attend by invitation only. An athlete's performance during the combine can affect their draft status and salary, and ultimately their career. The draft has popularized the term "workout warrior", whereby an athlete's "draft stock" is increased based on superior measurable qualities such as size, speed, and strength, despite having an average or sub-par college career.

The data collected at the Combine is in the below categories:

* `Year`: Year of attendance at the NFL combine
* `Player`: Player name
* `Age`: Players age (years)
* `School`: College attended
* `Height`: Height (meters)
* `Weight`: Weight (kilograms)
* `Sprint_40yd`: 40 yard sprint time (seconds)
* `Vertical_Jump`: Vertical jump result (centimeters) 
* `Bench_Press_Reps`: Maximum bench press repetitions achieved while lifting 102.1 kg (225 lb) weight
* `Broad_Jump`: Broad jump result (centimeters)
* `Agility_3cone`: Three-cone agility test time (seconds)
* `Shuttle`: Lateral shuttle time (seconds)
* `Drafted..tm.rnd.yr.`: Team the athlete was drafted by, draft round, draft pick, and year
* `BMI`: Body mass index (kg/m2)
* `Player_Type`: Offensive or defensive player or special teams
* `Position_Type`: Broad classification of the athlete's playing position
* `Position`: Playing position
* `Drafted`: Was the player drafted during the NFL draft?
